# Go APIs and Tools

A personal collection of Go projects exploring backend development, API design, and system-level programming.  
This repository includes everything from real-time chat services and Redis-like storage to distributed systems, ecommerce APIs, and more.

Each project is built to learn, experiment, and improve backend architecture using Go.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

- ✅ RESTful APIs
- ⚙️ System tools & distributed services
- 💬 Real-time communication (WebSocket-based)
- 📦 Custom key-value store & Redis clone
- 🛠️ Playground for exploring Go features

> Not focused on UI — just pure backend logic, performance, and code structure.
